# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Instructions
---
Before starting: It is assumed that you already downloaded the data onto your current location, if not, you may get it from:

    https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Instructions:
* Fork a copy of "run_analysis.R" code located on the home page of this repo to your machine.
* In R please source that code file.
* Execute the function "run" with an optional parameter pointing to where "UCI HAR Dataset" is located.
*
Note1: if "UCI HAR Dataset" resides on your current directory, just call the "run" function without parameters.
Note2: I was unable to summarise (dplyr) an unknown set of columns, reason why in the code I needed to mention each one.

Thanks, wish me luck while I whish you luck in yours!
