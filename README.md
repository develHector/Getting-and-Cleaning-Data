Instructions
---
Before starting: It is assumed that you already downloaded the data onto your current location, if not, you may get it from:

    https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Instructions:
* Rest assured you have both plyr and dplyr packages installed
* Fork a copy of "run_analysis.R" code located on the home page of this repo to your machine.
* Get into R and source that code file.
* Execute the function "run" with an optional parameter pointing to where "UCI HAR Dataset" is located, for example, run("data") in my case. Note1: if "UCI HAR Dataset" resides on your current directory, just call the "run" function without parameters.
* Results will be returned from that function, you can either display them, store them to a dataframe, etc...
* Column names corresponds with those of the original datasets, just without the parentheses

Thanks, wish me luck while I whish you luck in yours!
